# RothkoPainting
This project is a simple HTML and CSS representation inspired by the abstract paintings of Mark Rothko. It uses layered boxes with various colors, blurs, and shadows to create a visual effect reminiscent of Rothko's iconic color field paintings.

## Project Overview
The project consists of:

A canvas with three colored blocks representing abstract shapes.
A frame that mimics the look of a painting's border.
A blurred background to create depth and softness.
This project is part of a freeCodeCamp exercise to practice CSS positioning, box shadows, filters, and transformations.

## Technologies Used

CSS3
## Features
Responsive design with a centered canvas and frame.
Realistic box shadows and blur effects for a layered, painted look.
